symlink this repo to a custom plugin folder in a forked runelite repo
```
cd ~/code/runelite/runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins
ln -s ~/code/tts-runelite ./tts
```
after getting chat events from the runelite api, i started researching tts engines to use. 

i found [Natural Speech](https://github.com/phyce/rl-natural-speech) in the [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) repository...

i will leave this repository up as an example for myself if i come up with another plugin idea, or want to continue this one regardless.
